## Facade design Pattern
The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to aset of interfaces in a subsytem. Facade defines a higherlevel interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Design Principle
**Principle of Least Knowledge :** talk only to your immediate friends.
- it reduces the interaction between objects to just a few close friends.
- it prevents us from creating designs that have a large number of classes coupled together so that changes in one part of the system cascade to other parts.
