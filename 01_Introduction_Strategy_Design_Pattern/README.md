## Strategy Design Pattern

The strategy design pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that enables a class to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime, without altering the code that uses these algorithms.

## Design Principles

1. **Identify Variation:**
   - Identify the aspects of an application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

2. **Program to an Interface:**
   - Program to an interface, not an implementation.

3. **Favor Composition over Inheritance:**
   - Favor composition over inheritance.
